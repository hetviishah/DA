Currently I am pursuing the course Data Analysis from Tops Technologies.
Data analysis is all about data gethering - data cleaning - data transforming - data validation - creating various visualizations and much more.
First of all we have to gether the data from various data sources available on internet which calles raw data.After that we have to clean these data by removing null values,replacing missing values,converting approprite fields.By cleaning data we get the refined data which called structered data.Lastly we can create many graphs,tables or visualization by these structered data.By moving these all graphs into one page makes a dashboard which is very useful for the companies to make customer satisfied by visualizing this all graph at a one time which shows companies growth as well.
